# Contributing to the Jovo Framework

Thanks a lot for considering to contribute to Jovo ‚ù§Ô∏èüîä

Jovo is an open source framework that makes it easier for developers to build cross-platform voice and chat apps.

Here are some suggestions how you can help us to make Jovo better:

## Spread the Word

You don't have to make large code changes to Jovo to become a contributor. Help other people discover Jovo by sharing or creating content.

- Leave us a star on GitHub and increase Jovo's visibility as an open source framework.
- Maybe help someone with a question in our [community forum](https://community.jovo.tech/).
- Write a tutorial or record a video to share your learnings with the community.
- Give a presentation and speak about Jovo at a local meetup or online event.

## Share Code

You can have a huge impact on Jovo without ever touching the framework's core.

- Open source a [project](https://github.com/FlorianHollandt/skillPlayer-basic) and help others learn Jovo by showing your code.
- Build a [plugin](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/plugins) and help others extend Jovo easily.

## Add new Features

Adding to Jovo's core can sometimes be daunting for beginners. Here are some ideas.

- Investigate [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework/issues) and find out what people are currently discussing.
- Take a look at our [community forum](https://community.jovo.tech/) to see what Jovo users are missing.
