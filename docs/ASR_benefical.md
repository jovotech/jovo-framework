THE MOST BENEFICIAL OF ASR

ASR systems recognize single-word entries such as yes-or-no responses and spoken numerals. This makes it possible for people to 
work their way through automated menus without having to enter dozens of numerals manually with no tolerance for error. 
In a manual-entry situation, a customer might hit the wrong key after having entered 20 or 30 numerals 
at intervals previously in the menu, and give up rather than call again and start over. 
ASR virtually eliminates this problem.
