# RIDR Lifecycle

Learn more about one of the key concepts of Jovo: The RIDR (_Request - Interpretation - Dialogue & Logic - Response_) Lifecycle.

## Introduction

![RIDR Lifecycle: Request - Interpretation - Dialogue & Logic - Response](https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2021/05/ridr-lifecycle-1.png)

The RIDR Lifecycle is an essential process of a Jovo app. Each user request flows through the lifecycle that integrates with various services. At the end, RIDR returns a response back to the user.

RIDR includes four key elements:

- [Request](#request): Collecting raw data and native platform requests
- [Interpretation](#interpretation): Turing raw data into structured input
- [Dialogue & Logic](#dialogue--logic): Mapping structured input to structured output
- [Response](#response): Turning structured output into native platform responses

You can find a long-form introduction to RIDR on [Context-First: An Introduction to Voice and Multimodal Interactions](https://www.context-first.com/introduction-voice-multimodal-interactions/).

## Request

The Request step starts the interaction and captures necessary data.

This step includes a few things, depending on the platform you're building for:

- Platforms like Alexa and Google Assistant do a lot of the grunt work (capturing input, doing speech recognition and natural language understanding) for you and already come with fully populated JSON requests that include a user ID, data about the user inquiry (sometimes even `intents` and `entities`) and more
- For custom interfaces (for example web, mobile, or custom hardware), you need to take care of the user input recording yourself. Jovo helps with this process. [Take a look at our clients for more information](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/tag/clients).

This step populates the Jovo `$request` object.

## Interpretation

The Interpretation step tries to make sense of the data gathered from the [Request](#request).

Some platforms (like Alexa and Google Assistant) already come with structured data like `intents` and `entities`. For others, there is the need to integrate with additional services.

Here are some of the things that might happen in this step:

- [ASR](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/tag/asr): If the `$request` contains raw audio, a speech recognition service could be used to turn it into raw text
- [NLU](./nlu.md): A natural language understanding service turns raw text into structured input (`intents`, `entities`)
- Potentially, you can plug in any other service, e.g. emotion detection, sentiment analysis, and more

This step populates the [Jovo `$input` object](./input.md).

## Dialogue & Logic

In the Dialogue & Logic step it is determined how and what should be responded to the user.

This step consists of both dialogue management and domain/business logic. You can find a long-form [introduction to dialogue management on Context-First](https://www.context-first.com/dialogue-management-introduction/).

Here are some of the things that happen in this step:

- [Routing](./routing.md): Determines the component and handler that should fulfill the request
- [Components](./components.md): The key elements that structure the dialogue into reusable elements
- [Handlers](./handlers.md): Functions that fulfill a specific request
- Services: Utility classes that keep business logic separated dialogue (handlers)
- [Output](./output.md): The result of a handler is to return an appropriate output

The Dialogue & Logic step usually ends with a populated [Jovo `$output` array](./output.md).

## Response

In the final Response step, the `$output` array from the previous step is translated into a native platform `$response`. [Learn more about the Jovo `$response` object here](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/response).

This response is then returned back to the platform.

## Middlewares

For a detailed look into all the RIDR [middlewares](./middlewares.md) that are executed as part of the RIDR Lifecycle, take a look at table below.

| Middleware             | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `request.start`        | Enters the `request` middleware group                                                    |
| `request`              | Turns the raw JSON request into a `$request` object                                      |
| `request.end`          | Leaves the `request` middleware group with propagated `$request` object                  |
| `interpretation.start` | Enters the `interpretation` middleware group                                             |
| `interpretation.asr`   | ASR/SLU integrations turn speech audio into raw text                                     |
| `interpretation.nlu`   | NLU integrations turn raw text into structured input                                     |
| `interpretation.end`   | Leaves the `interpretation` middleware group with propagated `$nlu` object               |
| `dialogue.start`       | Enters the `dialogue` middleware group                                                   |
| `dialogue.router`      | Uses information from the `interpretation` steps to find the right component and handler |
| `dialogue.logic`       | Executes the component and handler logic                                                 |
| `dialogue.end`         | Leaves the `dialogue` middleware group with propagated `$output` array                   |
| `response.start`       | Enters the `response` middleware group                                                   |
| `response.output`      | Turns `$output` into a raw JSON response                                                 |
| `response.tts`         | TTS integrations turn text into speech output                                            |
| `response.end`         | Leaves the `response` middleware group with propagated `$response` object                |
