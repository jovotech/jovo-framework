# Handlers

Handlers are methods inside a [Jovo component](./components.md) that are responsible for handling a request and returning output.

## Introduction

![A handler taking in multiple request types like intent requests, launch requests, or touch requests. The handler then results in some output.](img/handler-requests-output.png)

A handler can fulfill multiple types of requests, like intents and touch selections, and then return [output](./output.md).

A [component](./components.md) usually has multiple handlers. The `@Handle` decorator is used to define which handler should be responsible for which type of request. For example, one or multiple intents can be added as intents, and a handler can be even more specialized if you add conditions like platforms. [Learn more about handler routing below](#handler-routing-and-the-handle-decorator).

```typescript
import { Handle } from '@jovotech/framework';
// ...

@Handle({ /* handler options */ })
yourHandler() {
  // ...
}
```

The inside of a handler defines its logic. In the end, each handler should either return some output using the `$send()` method, or redirect/delegate to a different handler or component. [Learn more about handler logic below](#handler-logic).

```typescript
yourHandler() {
  // ...

  return this.$send('Hello world!');
}
```

## Handler Routing and the Handle Decorator

The routing defines which handler should fulfill the incoming request. For example, each intent in your [language model](./models.md) should have at least one handler that responds to it, otherwise the Jovo app might throw an error.

Similar to previous versions of Jovo, it is possible to name a handler exactly like the incoming intent it is supposed to respond to:

```typescript
ShowMenuIntent() {
  // ...
}
```

This does not offer a lot of flexibility, though. For better control, we recommend using the [`@Handle` decorator](./handle-decorators.md). It contains a set of elements that define when a handler should be triggered. This way, you can even add multiple intents and name the handler however you like.

For example, this handler responds to both the `ShowMenuIntent` and `YesIntent`:

```typescript
import { Handle } from '@jovotech/framework';
// ...

@Handle({
  intents: ['ShowMenuIntent', 'YesIntent']
})
showMenu() {
  // ...
}
```

[Learn more about the `@Handle` decorator here](./handle-decorators.md).

It's possible that multiple handlers are able to fulfill a request, for example:

```typescript
@Handle({
  intents: ['ShowMenuIntent']
})
showMenu() {
  // ...
}

@Handle({
  intents: ['ShowMenuIntent'],
  platforms: ['alexa']
})
showMenuOnAlexa() {
  // ...
}
```

If this is the case, the handler with more conditions is the one being prioritized. In the above example for a request coming from Alexa, the `showMenuOnAlexa` handler would be triggered.

[Learn more about handler prioritization in the routing docs](./routing.md#handler-and-component-prioritization).

## Handler Logic

Inside a handler is typically where the conversational logic is happening.

You can access all Jovo-related methods using the `this` context. For example, this is how you can write user data into a database:

```typescript
yourHandler() {
  // ...

  this.$user.data.someKey = 'someValue';

  // ...
}
```

A handler usually concludes with one of these tasks:

- [Return output using `$send()`](#return-output)
- [Redirect to a different component using `$redirect()`](#redirect-to-components)
- [Delegate to a component using `$delegate()`](#delegate-to-components)
- [Report back to a delegating component using `$resolve()`](#resolve-a-component)

### Return Output

In most cases, the goal of a handler is to return output to the user using the `$send` method.

```typescript
yourHandler() {
  // ...

  return this.$send(/* output */);
}
```

[You can find more information on output here](./output.md).

### Redirect to Components

If you `$redirect()` to a different component, the current one is removed from the [`$state` stack](./state-stack.md). You can see this as a permanent redirect.

If no handler name is specified, the redirect triggers the other component's `START` handler.

```typescript
import { AnotherComponent } from './AnotherComponent';
// ...

yourHandler() {
  // ...

  return this.$redirect(AnotherComponent);
}
```

You can also specify the name of a handler:

```typescript
import { AnotherComponent } from './AnotherComponent';
// ...

yourHandler() {
  // ...

  return this.$redirect(AnotherComponent, 'someHandler');
}
```

### Delegate to Components

By using the `$delegate` method, you can redirect to a different component and let it know that after successful delegation (when the delegated component [resolves](#resolve-a-component)), the flow should be returned to the current component.

```typescript
// src/components/YourComponent.ts

import { YesNoComponent } from './YesNoComponent';
// ...

yourHandler() {
  // ...

  return this.$delegate(YesNoComponent, {
    resolve: {
      yes: this.onYes,
      no: this.onNo,
    },
    config: {
      // ...
    }
  });
}

onYes() {
  // ...
}

onNo() {
  // ...
}
```

In the above example, the [`$state` stack](./state-stack.md) gets updated like this:

```typescript
$state = [
  {
    component: 'YesNoComponent',
  },
  {
    component: 'YourComponent',
    resolve: {
      yes: 'onYes',
      no: 'onNo',
    },
  },
];
```

The following options can be added to `$delegate()`:

- `resolve`: Handlers that should be called after the child component [resolves](#resolve-a-component) with certain data.
  - Can include references to handler functions like `this.onYes` (doesn't work with anonymous functions)
  - Can include a string to the handler key: `'onYes'`
- `config`: The config that is used by the child component. Can be accessed inside the child component with `this.config`

### Resolve a Component

In our previous example, a component [delegated](#delegate-to-components) to another component (e.g. `YesNoComponent`), expecting it to return a specific result.

After successful handling, the delegated component can use `$resolve()` to report back:

```typescript
// src/components/YesNoComponent.ts

YesIntent() {
  // ...

  return this.$resolve('yes');
}
```

The component is then removed from the [`$state` stack](./state-stack.md) and the delegating component is called, looking for a handler that matches the event that is passed with `$resolve()` (in the above example `yes`).

You can also pass data in the second argument. This is especially helpful if the delegation has been used for [slot filling](./entities.md#slot-filling). For example, if you have a `CityIntent` that uses the `city` entity, you can resolve it like this:

```typescript
CityIntent() {
  // ...

  return this.$resolve('success', this.$entities.city.resolved);
}
```

The accepting handler defined in [`$delegate`](#delegate-to-components) can use it as a parameter:

```typescript
onSuccess(city) {
  // ...
}
```

## Handler Types

There are some default handlers that you can use in your components:

- [`LAUNCH`](#launch)
- [`START`](#start)
- [`UNHANDLED`](#unhandled)

### LAUNCH

The `LAUNCH` handler only appears once in every project (typically the `GlobalComponent`) and is responsible for handling the initial start of the app. On voice assistants like [Alexa](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/platform-alexa) or [Google Assistant](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/platform-googleassistant), `LAUNCH` is entered when the app is opened using its invocation name.

```typescript
LAUNCH() {
  // ...
}
```

### START

`START` is entered when a component is [redirected](#redirect-to-components) or [delegated](#delegate-to-components) to without a specified handler name. We recommend using `START` in every component as best practice.

```typescript
START() {
  // ...
}
```

### UNHANDLED

`UNHANDLED` is called when no other handler in the current component can fulfill the current request. It can be seen as a catch-all of handlers in one specific component.

```typescript
UNHANDLED() {
  // ...
}
```

By default, the current component's `UNHANDLED` gets prioritized over global handlers in other components. Learn more about [`UNHANDLED` prioritization in the routing documentation](./routing.md#unhandled-prioritization).


## Middlewares

The `event.ComponentTreeNode.executeHandler` [event middleware](./middlewares.md#event-middlewares) gets called every time a handler is executed. For example, you can [hook](./hooks.md) into it like this:

```typescript
app.hook('after.event.ComponentTreeNode.executeHandler', (jovo: Jovo): void => {
  // ...
});
```
